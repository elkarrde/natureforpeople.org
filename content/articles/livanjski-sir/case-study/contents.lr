<h4 class="h2 grey playfair-heavy mb1">Implementation</h4>

        <dd>joint identification of issues and finding solutions with the partners</dd>
        <dd>organised visits to similar producers and fairs in Italy and Croatia, and, most recently, the Czech Republic and Slovakia</dd>

</dl>

<h4 class="h2 grey playfair-heavy mb1">Change</h4>
<dl class="clearfix">
    <dt>How was the negative environmental impact reduced?</dt>
        <dd>The constant increase of production prevents the overgrowing of grasslands and revives the neglected pastures. Some association members have over 1000 sheep. The grazing helps maintain the natural eco-systems and so does the mechanical mowing for the purpose of collecting hay for the winter.</dd>
        <dd>The total surface of the Livanjsko polje that is being maintained is 21,761 ha.</dd>

    <dt>Positive economic (E) and social (S) change in:</dt>
        <dd><strong>The public sector – national:</strong></dd>
        <dd>The importance of the association and its participation in working groups for the drafting of laws on the protection of food origin has been recognised.</dd>
        <dd><strong>The public sector – local:</strong></dd>
        <dd>The promotion of the area and local producers, increased visibility. The credibility of local authorities in relation to the donors has increased due to the implementation of a large-scale project. The municipality of Livno recognised the Cincar Association as the key partner in achieving strategic goals and the importance of this product to the recognisability of the area. The Livno cheese is also an important item in other strategic goals related to tourism and culture. For example: The “Cheese Days” event, although still emerging, is an integral part of the Livno cultural summer programme. The municipality of Livno gets an expo-sales area for its trademark product. The Herzeg-Bosnia County also included the small-volume producers in its support programmes, where before it has only supported large-scale dairy farms and their collaborators. Production development and the protection of the traditional Livno cheese is also included in the municipal and county development strategies. The process of drafting a county-wide rural development strategy, in which we’re actively participating, is currently in progress. </dd>
        <dd><strong>The business sector: </strong></dd>
        <dd>E: increased income, sustainable business activities</dd>
        <dd>S: promoting products and services, the possibility of networking and joint action. Solely local companies and supplier were contracted during the construction of the mini dairy farms and the common facility. The large-scale dairy farms producing cheese agreed to a dialogue, which has never been the case before. Local businesspeople (restaurants, merchants) gain quality partners and suppliers. By meeting the requirements for export into the EU countries, the product will make its way back to its primary market, the Dalmatian coast, where the “traditional Livno cheese” will once again be available without any legal issues. The same goes for all the restaurants and supermarket chains in the country and abroad, which will be able to offer traditional Livno cheese for the first time ever. </dd>
        <dd><strong>The local community:</strong></dd>
        <dd>Economic:</dd>
        <dd>The 50 families that are members of the Association of producers of the traditional Livno cheese “Cincar” draw economic benefits. At the moment, over 200 people make a living from this type of cheese production. About 20 families (that meet the requirements) founded the Cincar 2 Cooperative, within the project of the Czech Development agency, so that they could enter the market. The other families can join the cooperative as soon as they fulfil the requirements as stipulated by the ordinance.  Lower costs of laboratory production control.  Two people are employed full-time (two more planned).</dd>
        <dd>Social:</dd>
        <dd>Legalised market and products.  Product protection as part of the heritage and culture of the area. The cheese museum.  The public has been informed of the status and issues of traditional producers.</dd>
        <dd><strong>The scientific community:</strong></dd>
        <dd>Participating in protection processes from the beginning and enabling field work for students (Faculty of Agriculture and Food Science of Sarajevo) and monitoring the status and habitats of species.</dd>

    <dt>What’s your greatest contribution to the project?</dt>
        <dd>For the people</dd>
        <dd>Increasing the income of the local community based on our own products and services.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 class="h2 grey playfair-heavy mb1">Replication and recommendations</h4>
<dl class="clearfix bulleted">
    <dt>What are the key things essential to replication?</dt>
        <dd>founding a producers’ association and strengthening its capacities</dd>
        <dd>quality and recognisability of the producers</dd>
        <dd>including decision makers and managers in the very beginning of project implementation</dd>
        <dd>including scientific institutions, i.e. experts and students in the initial stage of the project </dd>
        <dd>persistence</dd>
        <dd>good cooperation between project partners and a common effort</dd>
