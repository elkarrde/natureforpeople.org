<dl class="clearfix">
    <dt>Key phases – from idea to realisation?</dt>
        <dd>Resolving institutional barriers (lack of recognition of low productivity in agricultural practice as a solution for nature conservation)</dd>
        <dd>Agricultural Lands Act (joint pastures in agricultural areas – commenting on laws, lobbying)</dd>

    <dt>Which actions did you take?</dt>
        <dd>Establishment of the Gajna Association of livestock breeders, which is legally entitled to manage the joint pastures, enabling it to receive subsidies from the agricultural system.</dd>
        <dd>Establishment of the Cooperation Council (including farmers, fishermen, hunters, border guards, municipalities, firefighters, Croatian Environment Agency, livestock breeders, Croatian Forests and Croatian Waters) as a means of ensuring cross-sectoral communications at both the local and national levels.</dd>
        <dd>Creation of synergy between the Environment Ministry and Agriculture Ministry on the overlap of agricultural and Natura 2000 lands.</dd>
        <dd>Placement of meat products from indigenous breeds (Slavonian Podolian cattle, Slavonian Black pig) in local restaurants.</dd>
        <dd>Development of educational trails and an info centre.</dd>

    <dt>Which vulnerable groups were included, and how?</dt>

        <dd>Establishment of the Cooperation Council (local) – inclusion of all sectors</dd>
</dl>

<h4 class="h2 grey playfair-heavy mb1">Changes (your contribution to change)</h4>
<dl class="clearfix bulleted">
    <dt>What are the positive changes for nature?</dt>
        <dd>Increase in the flora and fauna, endemic plants and animals, species under Natura 2000 protection</dd>
        <dd>Retaining indigenous breeds (Slavonian Podolian cattle, Slavonian Black pig)</dd>

    <dt>How were negative impacts on nature reduced?</dt>
        <dd>Flood control</dd>
        <dd>Control of invasive species</dd>
</dl>

<h4 class="h2 grey playfair-heavy mb1">Replication and recommendations</h4>
<dl class="clearfix bulleted">
    <dt>Which key items were important for replication?</dt>
        <dd>Volunteer work</dd>
        <dd>Motivation of members of the local community to launch the initiative</dd>
        <dd>Communication with various sectors (BED as initiator and facilitator)</dd>
        <dd>Dialogue with land managers (Natura Slavonica Public Institution)</dd>
        <dd>Keep in mind that results will only be visible after 2 years.</dd>

    <dt>What would you recommend to others?</dt>
        <dd>Persistence as the path to success.</dd>
        <dd>Constant communications with all parties.</dd>
        <dd>People are the key (16 families participated to their mutual economic benefit). Without people there is no sustainability, and the project must be their story.</dd>
        <dd>Livestock keeper is a socially unacceptable profession, BED had difficulty hiring a person even amongst 30% unemployment.</dd>
        <dd>Volunteers are an important aspect in project implementation.</dd>
