<p>WWF is presenting key findings of a
<a href="http://croatia.panda.org/en/what_we_do/protected_areas/pa4np/pa_bat_methodology/" class="cc-secondary">PA-BAT analysis</a>
that can provide information how various stakeholders perceive the current and potential values of protected areas. Based on the discussions which have involved more than 1300 experts, government officers, entrepreneurs, farmers and local community representatives in the region.</p>

<p>The estimated values of the protected area can be existential, economical, and have a potential for future revenue. The results of the assessment are relevant for PA managers, but also for national and local governments and local actors who are leading sustainable development initiatives.</p>
